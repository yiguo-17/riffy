# Iffy

### Introduction

Today you're going to make a little node app that can take in user input and spit out appropriate output. All on the command line. Because we're all ninjas now!


### Objectives

After completing this assignment, you will be able to:

* Parse command line text to find the arguments you want.
* Format those arguments if need be.
* Use if/else/else-if statements to branch your code.
* Output text back to the user.

### The Basics

You'll be making a node app that uses `process.argv` to take in input and `console.log` to provide output. And you get to pick what it does! There are some suggestions below, but you can _absolutely_ do something else. We'll be presenting these, so put your best foot forward!

If you need a reminder how to use `process.argv`, remember that we can use indices to grab different parts of it. Every _space-separated string_ the user writes after `node [filename].js` will be there, _starting at index 2_. (Index 0 is the string `'node'` and index 1 is the string containing your filename.) Importantly, they'll all come in as strings, so if you want booleans or numbers, you'll have to do conversion of one kind or another!


### Some Possible Apps To Make

Please feel free to use these as jumping off points to something else or to more extended versions of these! In fact, please make the best, most feature-filled version of whatever you're doing. Now and always. Please and thank you.

* Guessing Game

It takes in two numbers, a max and a guess. It calculates a random integer from 1 to the max (check out `Math.random()`!) and then checks it against the guess made, returning whether the user guessed right or not!

* Converter

The easy version of this is fahrenheit and celsius converters we made. The middle option is one that can take in as a separate argument the direction the conversion is going--are we converting to fahrenheit or celsius? The great app could convert not just temperature, but weight, size, length, etc. Then you would need a third argument--what are you converting _from_? With celsius/fahrenheit it's always the other one, but we could even convert from or to degrees _kelvin_, and there are many, many different units of length. Do as much as you can!

* Bill Split Calculator

This one would take in an overall bill, a tip percentage, and how many ways to split it, and calculates how much each party owes. For a really good version of this, you'd want to make the tip and how many ways to split it _optional_ parameters, so they could easily just figure the tip on their solo meal, or split it some number of ways with a default tip percentage.



### Other Ideas

Run ANYTHING else you want to do by us! As long as it's not absurdly easy or unrealistically time-consuming, we'll probably okay it.

Excelsior!
